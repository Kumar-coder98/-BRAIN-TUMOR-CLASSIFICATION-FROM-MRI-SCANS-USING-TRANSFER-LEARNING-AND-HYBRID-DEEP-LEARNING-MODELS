BRAIN-TUMOR-CLASSIFICATION-FROM-MRI-SCANS-USING-TRANSFER-LEARNING-AND-HYBRID-DEEP-LEARNING-MODELS
Novel hybrid framework for brain tumor classification using MRI scans. It combines deep feature extraction (ResNet152, EfficientNetB0, ViT-B16) with PCA and SVM. Achieved 99.83-100% accuracy, proving robust for clinical diagnostics.
